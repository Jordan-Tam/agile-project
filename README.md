# Expense Splitter

Our expense splitter app allows groups of people to track their expenses, including details such
as what they owe money for, who they owe money to, and how much money they owe. Users
can create new groups and ledgers, add expenses to those ledgers with rules and participants,
and update their balance when they have paid their portion. The user can also filter expenses
by group, as well as between expenses they owe and expenses owed to them.
